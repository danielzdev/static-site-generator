# Static markdown to website converter

This is my first, not trivial project, pretty fun so far!  
This is both the funnest time i've ever had, and also the worst. (READ I HATE PARSERS BUT MAN ARE THEY KINDA FUN TO CODE)  

Hope your having a good day so far, and that the rest of your day is good :)
